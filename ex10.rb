# An important escape sequence is to escape a single-quote ' or double-quote ". Imagine you have a string that uses double-quotes and you want to put a double-quote inside the string. If you write "I "understand" joe." then Ruby will get confused because it will think the " around "understand" actually ends the string. You need a way to tell Ruby that the " inside the string isn't a real double-quote.
